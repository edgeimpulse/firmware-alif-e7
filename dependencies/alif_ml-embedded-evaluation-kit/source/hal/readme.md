## HAL project

This directory is the root of `Hardware Abstraction Layer` (HAL) library for this repo. The intention is for this layer
to service higher layers to seamlessly use platform specific functionality via a single abstraction layer. HAL provides
drivers for each target platform that the repository supports.

See [Repository Structure](../../docs/documentation.md#repository-structure) for more details.
