# Arm® ML embedded evaluation kit

This repository is for building and deploying Machine Learning (ML) applications targeted for Arm® Cortex®-M and Arm®
Ethos™-U NPU.
To run evaluations using this software, we suggest using:

- an [MPS3 board](https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/development-boards/fpga-prototyping-boards/mps3) with
  [Arm® Corstone-300](https://developer.arm.com/Processors/Corstone-300) or [Arm® Corstone-310](https://developer.arm.com/Processors/Corstone-310) implementations.
  - Arm® Corstone™-300 runs a combination of
  the [Arm® Cortex™-M55 processor](https://www.arm.com/products/silicon-ip-cpu/cortex-m/cortex-m55) and the
  [Arm® Ethos™-U55 NPU](https://www.arm.com/products/silicon-ip-cpu/ethos/ethos-u55).
  - Arm® Corstone™-310 runs a combination of
      the [Arm® Cortex™-M85 processor](https://www.arm.com/products/silicon-ip-cpu/cortex-m/cortex-m85) and the
      [Arm® Ethos™-U55 NPU](https://www.arm.com/products/silicon-ip-cpu/ethos/ethos-u55).

- a [Arm® Corstone™-300 MPS3 based Fixed Virtual Platform (FVP)](https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/open-source-software/arm-platforms-software/arm-ecosystem-fvps)
  that offers a choice of the [Arm® Ethos™-U55 NPU](https://www.arm.com/products/silicon-ip-cpu/ethos/ethos-u55)
  or [Arm® Ethos™-U65 NPU](https://www.arm.com/products/silicon-ip-cpu/ethos/ethos-u65) software fast model in combination of
  the new [Arm® Cortex™-M55 processor](https://www.arm.com/products/silicon-ip-cpu/cortex-m/cortex-m55). You can also take advantage of
  [Arm Virtual Hardware](https://www.arm.com/products/development-tools/simulation/virtual-hardware) (AVH) and [run the Fixed Virtual Platform
  in the cloud](./docs/sections/arm_virtual_hardware.md).
  > **NOTE**: While Arm® Corstone™-300 is available as an [Ecosystem FVP](https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/open-source-software/arm-platforms-software/arm-ecosystem-fvps)
  > and AVH, Arm® Corstone™-310 is available (for both Arm® Ethos™-U55 and Ethos™-U65 NPUs) only as AVH implementations.

## Inclusive language commitment
This product conforms to Arm's inclusive language policy and, to the best of our knowledge,
does not contain any non-inclusive language. If you find something that concerns you, email terms@arm.com.

## Overview of the evaluation kit

The purpose of this evaluation kit is to allow users to develop software and test the performance of the Arm® Ethos-U NPU and
Arm® Cortex-M CPUs for ML workloads. The Ethos-U NPU is a new class of machine learning (ML) processor, specifically designed
to accelerate ML computation in constrained embedded and IoT devices. The product is optimized to execute
mathematical operations efficiently that are commonly used in ML algorithms, such as convolutions or activation functions.

## ML use cases

The evaluation kit adds value by providing ready to use ML applications for the embedded stack. As a result, you can
experiment with the already developed software use cases and create your own applications for Cortex-M CPU and Ethos-U NPU.
The example application at your disposal and the utilized models are listed in the table below.

The above use cases implement end-to-end ML flow including data pre-processing and post-processing. They will allow you
to investigate embedded software stack, evaluate performance of the networks running on Cortex-M55 CPU and Ethos-U NPU
by displaying different performance metrics such as inference cycle count estimation and results of the network execution.

## Software and hardware overview

The evaluation kit primarily supports [Arm® Corstone™-300](https://developer.arm.com/ip-products/subsystem/corstone/corstone-300)
and [Arm® Corstone™-310](https://developer.arm.com/ip-products/subsystem/corstone/corstone-310) reference packages as its
primary targets. Arm® Corstone™-300 and Corstone™-310 design implementations are publicly available on [Download FPGA Images](https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/development-boards/fpga-prototyping-boards/download-fpga-images) page,
or as a [Fixed Virtual Platform of the MPS3 development board](https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/open-source-software/arm-platforms-software/arm-ecosystem-fvps).

The Ethos-U NPU software stack is described [here](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/101888/0500/NPU-software-overview/NPU-software-components?lang=en).

All ML use cases, albeit illustrating a different application, have common code such as initializing the Hardware
Abstraction Layer (HAL). The application common code can be run on native host machine (x86_64 or aarch64) or Arm
Cortex-M architecture thanks to the HAL.
For the ML application-specific part, Google® TensorFlow™ Lite for Microcontrollers inference engine is used to schedule
the neural networks models executions. TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers is integrated with the
[Ethos-U NPU driver](https://review.mlplatform.org/plugins/gitiles/ml/ethos-u/ethos-u-core-driver)
and delegates execution of certain operators to the NPU or, if the neural network model operators are not supported on
NPU, to the CPU. If the operator is supported, [CMSIS-NN](https://github.com/ARM-software/CMSIS_5) is used to optimise
CPU workload execution with int8 data type. Else, TensorFlow™ Lite for Microcontrollers' reference kernels are used as
a final fall-back.
Common ML application functions will help you to focus on implementing logic of your custom ML use case: you can modify
only the use case code and leave all other components unchanged. Supplied build system will discover new ML application
code and automatically include it into compilation flow.

A high level overview of the different components in the software, and the platforms supported out-of-the-box, is shown
in the diagram below.

![APIs](docs/media/APIs_description.png)

For a more detailed description of the build graph with all major components, see [Building](./docs/documentation.md#building).

### Reusable software

There are source files in the repository that form the core of the Machine Leaning flow for all the use cases. These
are exposed as APIs that the examples can use and even be combined to form chained use cases. The API sources are
designed to be portable across platforms and provide functionality for preprocessing of data, running an inference, and
postprocessing of results. These allow a common flow for all use cases with minor differences in how each of these
blocks are instantiated.

As an independent CMake project, these APIs can be used by or integrated into other projects easily. We also produce
[CMSIS Packs](https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/embedded/cmsis/cmsis-packs) with these sources, so they
could be used in all tools/IDEs (for example,
[Arm® Development Studio](https://developer.arm.com/Tools%20and%20Software/Arm%20Development%20Studio) and
[Keil® µVision®](https://www2.keil.com/mdk5/uvision/)) that support the use of CMSIS Packs.

### Getting started

To run an ML application on the Cortex-M and Ethos-U NPU, please, follow these steps:

1. Set up your environment by installing [the required prerequisites](./docs/sections/building.md#Build-prerequisites).
> **NOTE**: A Docker image built from the `Dockerfile` provided will have all the required packages installed.
2. Generate an optimized neural network model for Ethos-U with a Vela compiler by following instructions [here](./docs/sections/building.md#Add-custom-model).
3. [Configure the build system](./docs/sections/building.md#Build-process).
4. [Compile the project](./docs/sections/building.md#Building-the-configured-project) with a `make` command.
5. If using a FVP, [launch the desired application on the FVP](./docs/sections/deployment.md#Fixed-Virtual-Platform).
If using the FPGA option, load the image on the FPGA and [launch the application](./docs/sections/deployment.md#MPS3-board).

**To get familiar with these steps, you can follow the [quick start guide](docs/quick_start.md).**

> **Note:** The default flow assumes Arm® *Ethos™-U55* NPU usage, configured to use 128 Multiply-Accumulate units
> and is sharing SRAM with the Arm® *Cortex®-M55*.
