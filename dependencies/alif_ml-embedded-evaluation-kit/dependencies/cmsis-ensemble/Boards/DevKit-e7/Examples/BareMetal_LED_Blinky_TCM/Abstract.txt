 Overview : Readme for BareMetal LED BLINK test application 
===================================================================

=======================
About LED Blink TestApp
=======================

 - The LED blink test application is developed as baremetal example.
 - led_blink_app function configures pin-14 & pin-15 of GPIO port-1 as a output to operate leds, using CMSIS GPIO module.
 - The Leds ds1 and ds2 will turn off and on alternately.
  (means for first cycle ds1=ON and ds2=OFF. next cycle ds1=OFF and ds2=On or vice-versa. this cycle will repeate infinate times).
 

=====================
 Toolchain supported
=====================
- ARM DS IDE 2020.1
- Alifsemiconductor.Ensemble.0.0.1.pack

=======================
 Hardware requirements:
=======================
- Alif Semiconductor CSP Board + Carrier Card set up with Host.

=======================
 Board Pin Connections
=======================

CSP board gpio connection to Carrier card as follows:
---------------------------------------
    CSP board                     Carrier Card
    Port 1 pin 14           ----> ds1 LED
    Port 1 pin 15           ----> ds2 LED
---------------------------------------
If both CSP and Carrier card connected, Internally above mentioned pins of the CSP borad is routed to leds of carrier card.
